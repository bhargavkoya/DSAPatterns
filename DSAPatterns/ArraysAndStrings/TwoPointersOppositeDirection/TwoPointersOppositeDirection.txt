 Two Pointers (Opposite Direction)
 📌
 Use one pointer from the start and another from the end, converging toward 
the center.
 🎯
 Why it matters:
 Solves many O(n) problems that naïvely take O(n²) using brute force.
 Great for sorted arrays, symmetric comparisons, and pair matching.
 Used in Amazon and Facebook for string/array logic.
