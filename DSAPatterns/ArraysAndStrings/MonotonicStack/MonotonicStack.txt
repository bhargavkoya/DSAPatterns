Monotonic Stack
📌
Stack that maintains increasing or decreasing order to find next/prev elements
🎯
Why it matters:
Efficient O(n) solutions to span, histogram, temperature, and next greater 
problems
Interviewers check invariant maintenance + optimization skills
🔁
Variants:
Next greater/smaller
Span problems
Histogram max area
🔥
Examples:
Leetcode 739  Daily Temperatures
Leetcode 84  Largest Rectangle in Histogram
Leetcode 496  Next Greater Element I
